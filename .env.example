# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# Supabase (public) required variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY"

# Model server
MODEL_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# YOLO model path (for model-server)
MODEL_PATH="../yolo/runs/detect/exp1/weights/best.pt" # Example path

# Optional: Skip env validation (development only)
# SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1
